1. We have learned that unlike virtual machines containers are not completely isolated from their host. Containers and the hosts share the same kernel. Containers are isolated using namespaces in Linux. The host has a namespace and the containers have their own namespace. All the processes run by the containers are in fact run on the host itself, but in their own namespaces.
