all access to host must disable password authentication, only use SSH based access
how to secure the cluster?
    control access kube-apiserver
        who can access?
            authenticate using files: 
                username and password
                username and token
                certificates
                ldap
                    all the above is considered user account and kubenetes dont manage it, we cannot create users using cmd
                    all the request such as curl or kubectl commands
                        1. kube-apiserver authenticates
                        2. static password file
                        3. stateic token file
                            for 2 and 3, create a csv 
                            --basic-auth-file=xx.csv
                            inside kube-apiserver.service
                                        execstart=
                            there is yaml for it also
                        when curling pass the user and password behind
                        exampe: 
                            curl -v -k https://master-node-ip:6443/api/v1/pods -u "user1:password123"
                            curl -v -k https://master-node-ip:6443/api/v1/pods --header "Authorization: Bearer xxasdfasdf"
                            
                service account
                    but we can create service account for bots to access 
        what can they do?
            RBAC authorization
            ABAC
            NODE
            webhook mode
        how kube-apiserver communicate with other components in the cluster? (kubelet, ETCD, kube proxy, kube scheduler, kube controller manger)\
            TLS connections
    control access between applications in the cluster
        by default all pods can access other pods in the cluster
        but we can manage using network policies
