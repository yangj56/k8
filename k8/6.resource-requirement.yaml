# node config
# pod uses what the node is configured (CPU, memory, disk space)
# kubernetes scheduler decideds how to assign the pod within a node
# if the node has not enough resources, the schedule will avoid this node and go to the next node
# if all nodes do not have enough resources, the pod deployment will show "pending (insufficient CPU)"
# default each pod/container consume (0.5 CPU, 256 mebibyte), scheduler uses these specs to check fo requirement
# we can set a limit for the resource usage on these pods, 
      # default: limit 1 vCPU.
      # default: limit 512 Mebibyte.
